								to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of
								our business. This policy reflects our commitment to act ethically and with integrity in all our business
								relationships and to implement and enforce proportionate systems and controls which address the
								risks of modern slavery and human trafficking. As part of our efforts to identify and mitigate the risks of
								modern slavery and human trafficking, we shall:<br>
								<ul>
									<li>Seek to build long term relationships with our suppliers and highlight to them our expectations
									of business behavior</li>
									<li>Seek to ensure that these entities have suitable anti-slavery and human trafficking policies
									and procedures in place</li>
								</ul>
								<br>
								We shall not knowingly support or deal with any business involved in slavery or human trafficking. The
								Directors take responsibility for implementing this policy and its objectives and shall provide training
								and adequate communication throughout GAİA to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not
								taking place within GAİA or its supply chains.
